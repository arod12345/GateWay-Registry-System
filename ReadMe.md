## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using React.js, a powerful library for building user interfaces. It is responsive and uses modern JavaScript (ES6+) features.
- **Backend**: The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js to handle server requests and manage the API logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used for storing gate activity logs and user information securely.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is used for securing API endpoints and ensuring only authorized personnel can access certain features.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Socket.IO is implemented for real-time gate activity updates.
- **Deployment**: The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## Installation

- **Clone the repository**
      
      git clone https://github.com/arod12345/GateWay-Registry-System.git
      cd GateWay-Registry-System

Install dependencies for the frontend and backend

Navigate to the client and server folders and run the following commands:

-**For the Frontend**:   
          
           cd client
           npm install

    



-**For the Backend**:

        cd server
        npm install

## Running the Application

After installing all dependencies, follow these steps to start the application.

Start the Frontend:

    npm run dev

Start the Backend:

    npm run server

Both frontend and backend should now be running, and the application can be accessed at http://localhost:5173 for the frontend.

## Add a ENV File
